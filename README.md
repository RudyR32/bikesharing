# Bike Sharing Feasability in Des Moines
## Introduction
The collection of Dashboards in this story illustrates our team's analysis on the feasibility of a bike share service in Des Moines.  At the center of our analysis were the questions: What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?  We did however branch out into other factors such as population density that will be explained through out the Story.
## New York Citibike Analysis
After reviewing the citibike data we have made several assumptions that we are going to base my assessment of the feasibility of a bike sharing service in Des Moines on.  In New York nearly 2/3rds of the adult population(16+) is in the work force.  Based off of the peak hours of use we are going to operate under the assumption that people are using Citibike as a way to travel to and from work.  This is also corroborated by the distribution of rider ages.  While their are some abnormalities in the data, such as the number of 51 year olds in the data set, it is clearly illustrated that the vast majority of riders fall into the age group that make up the work force. 

## New York vs Des Moines Dashboard
In New York 78.5% of the population is finding a way to get to work other than driving themselves where as in Des Moines 77.5% of the population is driving them selves to work.  One reason for this may be due to the travel times.  In New York the average travel time to work is more than 2 times longer than the travel time in Des Moines.  The final observation that I made is that New York is a much more densely populated city.  The population per square mile in New York is over 10 times that of Des Moines. Additionally to answer are initial question New York with over 8 million people is close to 40 times the size of Des Moines which only 216 thousand people.

## Summary
To conclude we would not recommend a bike sharing service in Des Moines.  We do believe that population plays a roll in the feasibility of a ride share service but does not prohibit smaller cities from supporting one.  A service like citibike is scalable however there are several factors that we found to be major red flags.  First, the population density being so much lower means that their would either need to be more than bikes per rider or that the bike stations would be further apart.  Second, the workforce does not to have the motivation for  finding alternative transportation.  This is evident not only because of the percentage of people who are driving themself to work but also because the commute times are much more managable.  We would conditionally recomend a more limitted ride sharing service to service the city center only.  In the map below we have mapped out the 14 largest attractions in Des Moines.  Of those 9 are within a mile and a half of each other in the down town area.  This leads me to believe that on a smaller scale a bike sharing service could work.
